To identify the greyscale value that corresponded to the boundary
pixels, Cell-ID produced a histogram of the greyscale values for every pixel in the image
(Supplementary Figure 1a); thus, for a 512x512 image, it produced a histogram with
more than 250,000 values. Even for images with many cells, the histogram showed a
narrow peak (indicated by the high peak region in the log-scale plot of Supplementary
Figure 1a) and a low-end tail. The low-end tail contained the darkest pixels, which
included the cell boundaries. Cell-ID defined boundary pixels to be those below a user-
defined threshold. In these experiments, we typically chose the threshold to be the mean
of the distribution less 1.5 standard deviations (Ïƒ)

The next step in locating the cells was to find sets of contiguous bright pixels
surrounded by these dark boundary pixels. Cell-ID did this by creating sets of contiguous
pixels whose values were above the threshold. The boundary pixels between these sets
thus corresponded to the boundary pixels of the cells. Cell-ID generally found one or two
very large sets (100,000 or more pixels), which were the pixels from the background of
the visual field. Yeast cells in the image showed up as smaller sets of contiguous pixels,
on the order of 100 to 1000 pixels.

For each set of contiguous pixels whose size fell within these ranges, Cell-ID found the boundary
region of the set, and all the pixels inside that boundary were labelled as a cell.
