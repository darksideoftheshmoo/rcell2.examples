\title{Perform a Circular Shift on an Image}
\usage{
circular_shift(img)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{A 2D or 3D array representing the image to be shifted. The dimensions 
should be specified as rows and columns for proper operation.}
}
\value{
A shifted image array where the content has been wrapped around to maintain 
continuity. The size and type of the returned array match the input.
}
\description{
Shifts the input image by half its dimensions along both axes, wrapping the image 
content around to ensure continuity at the boundaries. The function uses Fourier-style 
boundary conditions for wrapping.
}
\details{
The function calculates the shift amounts as half of the image's dimensions 
(floored) along each axis. It then applies the shift using the `imshift` function with 
`boundary_conditions = 2`, which corresponds to a Fourier-style wrapping of the image 
content at the edges.
}
\examples{
# Create a sample matrix
img <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)

# Apply a circular shift
shifted_img <- circular_shift(img)

}
